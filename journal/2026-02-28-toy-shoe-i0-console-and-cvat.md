# Journal — 2026-02-28 (Toy-vs-Shoe I0 Console + CVAT Onboarding)

## What I worked on
I completed the Iteration-0 perception workflow updates with emphasis on practical operator flow: data capture from the console, first-time CVAT instructions, and troubleshooting for Jetson bring-up and package/runtime verification.

---

## Topics covered

### 1) Jetson bring-up and package troubleshooting
- Diagnosed `toy_shoe_perception` not being discoverable in ROS despite a successful build.
- Walked through workspace/root path verification, clean rebuild, and environment sourcing checks.
- Confirmed failure mode where package artifacts exist but are not in the active ROS environment path.

### 2) Dataset readiness checks
- Verified that `dataset/yolo_i0` was missing and required files were not present (`samples.csv`, `data.yaml`, `split_manifest.json`, `classes.json`).
- Confirmed no CVAT export zips were available under `dataset/cvat/exports/`.
- Clarified that training/export cannot proceed until extraction + labeling + import/split are complete.

### 3) First-time CVAT guidance
- Provided beginner-friendly, step-by-step CVAT instructions:
  - one task per session
  - labels exactly `toy` and `shoe`
  - tight box annotations
  - export format `Ultralytics YOLO 1.0`
- Reiterated that CVAT split artifacts are ignored in this repo and session-separated splits are generated by scripts.

### 4) Console UI enhancements for training capture
Implemented and pushed the following operator improvements:
- Guided timed capture controls (`target images`, `extractor FPS`, `buffer`, `duration override`).
- Planned runtime estimate and capture-plan countdown/state.
- Clear output path visibility (bag root, active bag output, extracted output path).
- Pre-capture camera preview with topic selection.
- Layout update: preview stacked above capture controls.
- New collapsible layout for the training page:
  - `Pre-Capture Camera Preview` (expanded by default)
  - `Training + Data Capture` (expanded by default)
  - `Step-by-Step Instructions (First-Time Users)` (collapsed by default)

### 5) Documentation updates
- Added a dedicated beginner guide markdown:
  - `docs/perception/toy_shoe_training_data_capture_guide.md`
- Linked the new guide from:
  - `docs/perception/toy_shoe_i0_runbook.md`
  - `docs/README.md`

## Commits from this session
- `73558a5` `feat(console): add guided timed capture and output paths`
- `9b541de` `feat(console): add camera preview to training tab`
- `26f0d35` `feat(console): stack pre-capture preview above training card`
- `ad353cc` `feat(console): add collapsible training panels and beginner guide`

---

## Validation performed
- Frontend build succeeded:
  - `cd jetson/console/ui && npm run -s build`

---

## Next steps
1. Pull latest `feat/toy-shoe-i0` on Jetson and rebuild UI/ROS packages.
2. Restart the stack and confirm updated training page renders.
3. Run one full capture session, then complete one CVAT task end-to-end to validate the operator workflow.
