# Contributing For Agents

Back: [Agent Index](INDEX.md) | [Root Start Here](../../AGENTS.md)

## Rules
- Use feature branches only.
- Include doc updates for behavior/script changes.
- Keep diffs minimal and task-focused.
- Add "How to test" steps in each PR description.
- Avoid context bloat: do not paste full files or full logs; include short excerpts and file paths.
